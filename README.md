# Markup Paste

A [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com) module that allows you to paste text from the clipboard into the chat log as formatted text. It uses the [DF Chat Enhancements Module](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/df-chat-enhance) markdown format and has been tested to work with pasting formatted text from Discord and Notion.

This uses the [Turndown library](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown) to convert HTML to markdown.
